# Self Evaluation

- Functionality
  - For this project, I believe that I have at least met expectations with this category because my enigma class and command line are successfully implemented.

- OOP
  - For this project I believe I am also in the category of meet expectations because my methods are broken into logical components, I don't have any large or small classes, and I can explain why I set things up the way that I did.

- Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  - For this project I believe I am also in the category of meet expectations because my methods and classes are indendted and set up correctly. I also have clean code that is implemented correctly and with a good use of enumerables.

- TDD
 - For this project I believe I am inbetween the category of  of below expectations and meet expectations because my methods are tested although not perfectly, I kind of ran out of time when refactoring, and only my command line interface is not.
